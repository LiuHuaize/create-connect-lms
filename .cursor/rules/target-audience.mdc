# Target Audience and Design Principles

This project is a Learning Management System (LMS) specifically designed for **children aged 7-14**.

**Key Considerations:**

- **User Interface (UI):** Should be engaging, intuitive, visually appealing, and age-appropriate. Use bright colors, clear fonts, and potentially gamification elements.
- **User Experience (UX):** Needs to be simple and straightforward. Avoid complex navigation or overly technical jargon.
- **Content Tone:** Educational content and instructions should be clear, encouraging, and easy for the target age group to understand.
- **Accessibility:** Consider accessibility standards (WCAG) to ensure usability for children with diverse needs.
