# Coding Style and Conventions

- **Linting:** This project uses ESLint for code quality and consistency. Please adhere to the rules defined in `[eslint.config.js](mdc:eslint.config.js)`.
- **Formatting:** While a specific formatter isn't explicitly defined in the root, ensure code is well-formatted and readable. Consider integrating Prettier if not already used implicitly.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS is used for styling. Utilize utility classes as defined in `[tailwind.config.ts](mdc:tailwind.config.ts)`. Component styles might also be found in CSS files like `[src/index.css](mdc:src/index.css)` or component-specific CSS.
- **Naming Conventions:** Follow standard TypeScript/JavaScript naming conventions (e.g., camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes/components).
